            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Minecraft</STRONG> is a <MARK>sandbox game</MARK> developed and published by <MARK>Mojang Studios</MARK>.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Minecraft, players explore a procedurally generated, <mark>three-dimensional world</mark> with virtually infinite terrain made up of voxels (cubes). Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on the game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in multiplayer. The game's large community offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, player skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally created in 2009 by <mark>Markus "Notch" Persson</mark> using the <mark>Java</mark> programming language, Jens "Jeb" Bergensten was handed control over the game's continuing development following its full release in 2011. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by <mark>Microsoft</mark> for <mark>US$2.5 billion</mark>; Xbox Game Studios hold the publishing rights for the Bedrock Edition, the cross-platform version based on the mobile Pocket Edition which replaced the existing console versions in 2017. Bedrock is updated concurrently with Mojang's original Java Edition, although with numerous, generally small, differences.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minecraft is the <mark>best-selling video game</mark> of all time, with over <mark>350 million copies sold</mark> (as of 2025) and <mark>140 million monthly active players</mark> (as of 2021). It has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited as <mark>one of the greatest video games of all time</mark>; social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions have played prominent roles in popularizing the game. It also has been noted as a <mark>cultural touchstone for Generation Z</mark>, as they grew up playing the game online at a young age.[5] The game's speedrunning scene has attracted a significant following. Minecraft has been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. The wider Minecraft franchise includes several spin-off games, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Earth, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Legends. A live action film adaptation, titled <mark>A Minecraft Movie, was released in 2025</mark>, and became the <mark>second highest-grossing video game film of all time</mark>.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minecraft is a <mark>3D sandbox video game</mark> that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[6] The game also features an optional <mark>achievement system</mark>.[7] Gameplay is in the <mark>first-person perspective</mark> by default, but players have the option of <mark>third-person perspectives</mark>.[8] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes, referred to as blocks—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a <mark>3D voxel grid</mark>, while players can move freely around the world. Players can break, or mine, blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[9] Very few blocks are affected by gravity, instead maintaining their voxel position in the air.[10]

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players can also craft a wide variety of items, such as armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as <mark>swords</mark> or <mark>bows and arrows</mark>), which allow monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as <mark>pickaxes</mark> or <mark>shovels</mark>), which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. They may also freely craft helpful blocks—such as furnaces which can cook food and smelt ores,[11] and torches that produce light—or exchange items with villagers <mark>(NPC)</mark> through trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.[12][13] The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items.[14] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.[15] The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.[16][17]

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New players are given a randomly selected default character <mark>skin</mark> out of nine possibilities, including <mark>Steve</mark> or <mark>Alex</mark>,[18][19] but are able to create and upload their <mark>own skins</mark>.[20] Players encounter various mobs (short for mobile entities) including <mark>animals, villagers,</mark> and <mark>hostile creatures</mark>.[13][21] Passive mobs, such as <mark>cows, pigs,</mark> and <mark>chickens</mark>, spawn during the daytime and can be hunted for food and crafting materials, while hostile mobs—including large <mark>spiders, witches, skeletons, and zombies</mark>—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves.[22][23] Some hostile mobs, such as zombies and skeletons, burn under the sun if they have no headgear and are not standing in water.[24] Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the <mark>creeper</mark> (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the <mark>enderman</mark> (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks).[25] There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans, respectively.[26]

        <big>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minecraft features three independent dimensions accessible through portals and providing alternate game environments. The Overworld is the starting dimension and represents the real world, with a terrestrial surface setting including plains, mountains, forests, oceans, caves, and small sources of lava.[29][25]

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nether is a hell-like underworld dimension accessed via an obsidian portal and composed mainly of lava.[36][37] Mobs that populate the Nether include shrieking, fireball-shooting ghasts,[38] alongside anthropomorphic pigs called piglins and their zombified counterparts.[39] Piglins in particular have a bartering system, where players can give them gold ingots and receive items in return.[40] Structures known as Nether Fortresses generate in the Nether, containing mobs such as wither skeletons and blazes, which can drop blaze rods needed to access the End dimension.[41] The player can also choose to build an optional boss mob known as the Wither, using skulls obtained from wither skeletons and soul sand.[42]

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End can be reached through an end portal, consisting of twelve end portal frames. End portals are found in underground structures in the Overworld known as strongholds. To find strongholds, players must craft eyes of ender using an ender pearl and blaze powder. Eyes of ender can then be thrown, traveling in the direction of the stronghold. Once the player reaches the stronghold, they can place eyes of ender into each portal frame to activate the end portal.[43] The dimension consists of islands floating in a dark, bottomless void. A boss enemy called the Ender Dragon guards the largest, central island.[44] Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which, when entered, cues the game's ending credits and the End Poem, a roughly 1,500-word work written by Irish novelist Julian Gough,[45] which takes about nine minutes to scroll past,[46] is the game's only narrative text,[47] and the only text of significant length directed at the player.[48]: 10–12  At the conclusion of the credits, the player is teleported back to their respawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.[49]

    <p>
        <big>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[29] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter in order to survive at night.[29] The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game unless the player is playing on peaceful difficulty.[50] If the hunger bar is empty, the player starves. Health replenishes when players have a full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful.[50]

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon losing all health, players die. The items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be changed by sleeping in a bed or using a respawn anchor.[51][52] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points (commonly referred to as "xp" or "exp") by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, animal breeding, and cooking food.[53] Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.[22]

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game features two more game modes based on Survival, known as Hardcore mode and Adventure mode. Hardcore mode plays identically to Survival mode, but with the game's difficulty setting locked to "Hard" and with permadeath, forcing them to delete the world or explore it as a spectator after dying.[54] Adventure mode was added to the game in a post-launch update,[55] and prevents the player from directly modifying the game's world. It was designed primarily for use in custom maps, allowing map designers to let players experience it as intended.[55][56]

            <big>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Creative mode, players have access to an infinite number of all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or mine them instantly.[57] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters usually do not take any damage nor are affected by hunger.[58][59] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.[57]

    <big>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiplayer in Minecraft enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. It is available through direct game-to-game multiplayer, local area network (LAN) play, local split screen (console-only), and servers (player-hosted and business-hosted).[60] Players can run their own server by making a realm, using a host provider, hosting one themselves or connect directly to another player's game via Xbox Live, PlayStation Network or Nintendo Switch Online. Single-player worlds have LAN support, allowing players to join a world on locally interconnected computers without a server setup.[61] Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the server.[60] Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. The largest and most popular server is Hypixel, which has been visited by over 14 million unique players.[62][63] Player versus player combat (PvP) can be enabled to allow fighting between players.[64]
