                    The GIVA rhombus captures the magic of life's tiny sparkles: a twinkling eye, a warm smile, a fleeting spark of joy. The logo at the end of our name is also a nod to the inspiration behind choosing the word GIVA. Derived from the word 'hill' in Sanskrit, our logo reflects our name's meaning and is a potent symbol of your unstoppable climb. 
         It is also inspired by the Sanskrit word "jeeva" (जीव), meaning life, symbolising our aspiration to celebrate the beauty of life through our jewellery creations.</dd></dt></dl>
