        <big><p>Huang Ying Zi, Jiang Yi, Fang Ming Yu, Zhuang Yuan, Lan Yi Fei, and Guan Chao all grew up together in Hangtian City, and they became known as the "Hangtian City F6". The good friends had promised to be together for the rest of their lives but were forced to abandon their promise because of an incident in the year of their Gaokao college entrance examination.

Twelve years later, at the age of 30, they each walked alone on their respective paths of life, working hard and growing up in the adult world. Suddenly, one day, they received the news that their good friend Guan Chao was about to get married. With the help of Huang Ying Zi, the old friends reunited during the wedding, and their memories of youth slowly unfolded.

Only then did they realize that the feelings that had sprouted when they were seventeen had never dissipated, and there were many misunderstandings behind the accident... in fact, the friendship that stayed in the past had never ended.</p></big>

       <p><big>Huang Yingzi is a warm, sentimental, and emotionally expressive woman who holds her childhood memories very close to her heart. Growing up surrounded by her close group of friends, she formed deep emotional bonds—especially with Jiang Yi, whom she cared for in a quiet, steady way. As an adult, she struggles with unresolved feelings, past hurts, and emotional wounds she never learned to express. Her return to the group’s shared past allows her to finally confront buried emotions and rediscover the love she tried to forget. Yingzi’s character represents healing, nostalgia, and the courage to face one’s own heart after years of silence.</p></big>

       <p><big>Jiang Yi is gentle, calm, and introspective, the type of person who feels deeply but speaks sparingly. As a child, he had a strong emotional connection with Yingzi, but misunderstandings and life circumstances forced him to leave their hometown. Even after growing up and moving abroad, he never truly let go of the memories they shared. Jiang Yi carries a quiet longing and a sense of regret, but also a deep loyalty that shapes everything he does. His reunion with Yingzi forces him to confront the feelings he hid for years and gives him the chance to finally express the love he never stopped holding onto.</p></big>

       <p><big>Fang Mingyu is outwardly strong and hardworking, but internally fragile and guarded. She acts mature and composed, but she hides a long-lasting affection for Zhuang Yuan, her childhood friend. Life’s challenges make her build emotional walls, and she often struggles to admit her true feelings. Despite her fears, she is loyal, caring, and determined to protect the friendships she values. Over time, she learns to trust again and accept love, allowing her relationship with Zhuang Yuan to grow into something warm, sincere, and healing.</p></big>

       <p><big>Zhuang Yuan is intelligent, dependable, and kind-hearted—the “scholar” of the group. From childhood, he was known for being rational and focused, but when it came to love, he often hesitated and kept his feelings hidden. He cared deeply for Fang Mingyu for years yet lacked the courage to express it openly. As an adult, Zhuang Yuan learns to balance logic with emotion and begins to understand the importance of honesty in relationships. His slow, steady love story with Mingyu reflects growth, maturity, and the beauty of long-awaited affection.</p></big>

       <p><big>Lan Yi Fei is gentle, elegant, and observant—someone who notices the small details others overlook. She carries a calm, comforting presence and often becomes the emotional stabilizer of the friend group. Yi Fei is thoughtful and introspective, but she sometimes struggles with self-doubt. Her journey is about finding her voice, valuing herself, and realizing that she doesn’t have to dim her light for the sake of harmony.</p></big>

       <p><big>Guan Chao is straightforward, energetic, and a bit impulsive, making him the dynamic force in the group. He is fiercely protective of the people he cares about and is unafraid to confront problems head-on. Although his actions can be reckless, they always come from a place of sincerity. As the story unfolds, Guan Chao learns patience, responsibility, and what it truly means to support someone without controlling them.</p></big>
